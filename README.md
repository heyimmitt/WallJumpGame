hi welcome to my first ever readme,
here is my gdd for the game: 

(forgive me if this is badly formatted or just unintelligible nonsense, this is my first time doing any of this)

Title: Wall Jumper (really original, yeah i know)

Genre: Hypercasual

Platform: PC (windows)

Setting: you fell down into a strange and mysterious well and must get out of it. it seems endless, so endlessly you must jump on its walls
(im sorry i couldn't think of anything cool)

Game mechanics: 

- space to jump and switch from one wall to another
- avoid the obstacles that are there on the wall for some reason
